<h3> About </h3>
<label>Top Keyboards 2020 was founded in 2020 by Brenner Haverlock and the point of this project was to showcase the top keyboards of 2020 and allow the user to purchase these items in real time.
    Every week these items are changed and the showcase will show the top 12 keyboards for gaming, ergonomic design, and desk work. This website was made because of the extensive reseach that must go into buying a new keyboard. 
    This website is great for gift giving as everything on this website is relevant and updated. Most keyboards are mechanical as it's the best keyboard for typing and gaming. Some of these keyboards however, are not mechanical and those keyboards are meant for desktop work and ergonomic seeking people. Using Bootstrap,HTML, CSS, and Javascript we were able to create this dynamic
    website. Thanks for checking out my website!
